# ALEX4
ALEX is designed to compare electoral systems, on the basis of the votersâ€™ preferences for the parties and the candidates (simulated, or from surveys).
The user can enter the parameters into the program (distribution of first preferences, size of the districts, etc.), or load them from a file. The program computes the resulting parliament, representativeness indexes and governability indexes according to the chosen electoral system.
The program can implement uninominal and plurinominal systems.

ALEX has been developed by Prof. Guido Ortona and Marie-Edith Bissey at University of Eastern Piedmont (Alessandria, ITALY).
